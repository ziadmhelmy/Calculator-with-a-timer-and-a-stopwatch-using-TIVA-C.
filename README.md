# Simple Calculator with Timer and Stopwatch
## Project Description
### Objectives
The goal of this project is to design a simple calculator with two additional features: a timer and a stopwatch. The calculator will perform basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The timer and stopwatch features will be managed separately by the hardware.
### Features
This project includes three main modes:
#### 1.0 Calculator Mode
In this mode you will be asked to take inputs from the user and print that input on the LCD. 
You will take two numbers or more (each more than 1 digit) and a sign between them. Use the 
keypad numbers to get the numbers.
A button: +
B button: -
C button: *
D button: /
"#" button: =
#### 2.0 Timer Mode
Set the desired time using keypad buttons.
Press # to start the timer.
The timer will trigger a red light when it reaches zero.
#### 3.0 Stopwatch Mode
Use "#" to start the stopwatch and increment the time.
Press "A" to pause or resume the stopwatch.
Press "B" to reset the stopwatch value to 00:00.
