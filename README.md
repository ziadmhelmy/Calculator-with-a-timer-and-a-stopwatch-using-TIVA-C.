Simple Calculator with Timer and Stopwatch
Project Description
Objectives
The goal of this project is to design a simple calculator with two additional features: a timer and a stopwatch. The calculator will perform basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The timer and stopwatch features will be managed separately by the hardware.

Features
This project includes three main modes:

Calculator Mode
In this mode, the program will prompt the user to enter inputs and display them on the LCD screen.
Users can enter two or more numbers (each consisting of more than one digit) and a mathematical operator using the keypad.
Keypad mappings:
A button: Addition (+)
B button: Subtraction (-)
C button: Multiplication (*)
D button: Division (/)
button: Calculate and display the result (=)
Timer Mode

In this mode, users can set a specific time using the keypad.
The timer will commence counting down once the "#" button is pressed.
When the timer reaches zero, it will trigger a red light.
Stopwatch Mode
